# GPIO Read 
`Brainbox must run on an Raspberry Pi to use this functionality`

## About the GPIO 
A powerful feature of the Raspberry Pi is the row of GPIO (general-purpose 
input/output) pins along the top edge of the board. A 40-pin GPIO header is 
found on all current Raspberry Pi boards (unpopulated on Pi Zero and Pi Zero W). 
Prior to the Pi 1 Model B+ (2014), boards comprised a shorter 26-pin header.

Any of the GPIO pins can be designated (in software) as an input or output pin 
and used for a wide range of purposes.

It is possible to `read` from the GPIO pins using Brainbox as shown below. Of 
course it is necessary that brainbox is started on a Raspberry Pi in order to 
access the GPIOS pins. After that you can connect to brainbox with your browser 
as usual and access the pins.
